# Crop Dietary Nutrition Ontology

The CDNO provides structured terminologies to describe nutritional attributes of crop plants
and their harvested materials that contribute to human diet. These terms are intended primarily
to be associated with datasets that quantify concentration of chemical nutritional components
derived from plant samples. Additional knowledge associated with these dietary sources may
be represented by terms that describe functional, physical and other attributes.
Whilst recognising that dietary nutrients within crop and food substrates may be present as
complex and dynamic physical and chemical structures or mixtures, CDNO focuses on
components typically quantified in an analytical chemistry laboratory. The primary CDNO
class ‘dietary nutritional component’ contains hierarchical sets of terms organised to reflect
commonly used classifications of chemical food composition. This class does not represent an
exhaustive classification of chemical components, but focuses on structuring terms according
to widely accepted categories. This class is independent of, but may be used in conjunction
with, classes that describe ‘analytical methods’ for quantification, ‘physical properties’ or
‘dietary function’. Quantification data may be used and reported in research literature, to
inform food composition tables and labelling, or for supply chain quality assurance and control.
More specifically, terms within the ‘nutritional component concentration’ class may be used
to represent quantification of components described in the ‘dietary nutritional component’
class in conjunction. Concentration data are intended to be described in conjunction with post-
composed metadata concepts represented as FoodOn ‘organismal material’, which derives
from Plant Ontology ‘plant anatomical entity’, and the NCBI organismal classification
ontology (NCBITaxon). In addition, one or more CDNO analytical method term may be used
to describe the process used to acquire concentration data, where these terms may be inherited
from the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI), the Chemical Methods ontology
(CHMO) or the Physico-chemical Methods and Properties ontology (FIX). In combination
these formalise the language used to describe sample source and status in the crop
production/food supply chain.Additional knowledge relating to interactions of crop-derived food components with human
physiological function is embodied within the CNDO dietary function class, where a nutritional
component may be associated with one or more functional categories.
The common vocabulary and relationships defined within CDNO should facilitate description,
communication and exchange of plant-derived nutritional composition datasets typically
generated by analytical laboratories. The organisation of the vocabulary is structured to reflect
common categories variously used by plant scientists and breeders, the crop production and
food supply sector, nutritionists, compilers and users of food composition databases. The
CDNO therefore supports characterisation of crop diversity and management of plant genetic
resources, as well as sharing of knowledge relating to dietary composition between a wider set
of researchers, breeders, farmers, processors and other stakeholders. Further development of
the functional class should assist in understanding how crop plant genetic and environmental
variation contributes to human diet and health in the farm to fork continuum.

A more descriptive guide for the Crop Dietary Nutrition Ontology (CDNO) was published in Crop Science in an article by Andres-Hernandez et al. 2020 [doi:10.1002/csc2.20092](https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/csc2.20092).
