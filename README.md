# Crop Dietary Nutrition Ontology

The Crop Dietary Nutrition Ontology (CDNO) assists with the management and navigation of dietary nutritional components derived from crops, enabling consistent vocabulary to be associated with data obtained from growing plants, via harvested materials and through the food supply chain to consumed food. This includes major classes to describe chemical components, analytical methods, and functional attributes. A key motivation has been to facilitate the comparison of nutritional values between different crops and cultivation scenarios. In developing the scope and design specification for CDNO (Andrés-Hernández et al., 2020) we wished to ensure compatibility with vocabularies that describe relevant aspects of food supply, processing and consumption. The CDNO is rooted in the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO). It reuses terminologies from OBO Foundry ontologies such as the Chemical Entities for Biological Interest (CHEBI), Food Ontology (FoodOn) and the Environmental Ontology (ENVO). The CDNO has been designed to represent three different domains: CDNO: dietary nutritional components, CDNO: dietary function and CDNO: analytical method. 
A more descriptive guide for the Crop Dietary Nutrition Ontology (CDNO) was published in Crop Science in an article by Andres-Hernandez et al. 2020 [doi:10.1002/csc2.20092](https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/csc2.20092).
